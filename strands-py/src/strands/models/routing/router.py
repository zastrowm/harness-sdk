"""ModelRouter: a reusable, immutable set of candidate models with a routing strategy.

A router is a ``Plugin``, so an agent accepts it through ``model=``. Its ``RoutingStrategy`` makes every
routing decision: the router asks for a candidate before the first model call, and again after a call
fails without a hook claiming the retry, passing the attempts so far.

The router orchestrates only. It resolves a candidate to a concrete model, applies it to the call, gives
each new candidate a fresh retry budget, and holds per-invocation state. It has no failover policy, so a
strategy can change routing behavior without changing the router.

The strategy defaults to ``FallbackStrategy``, which makes ``ModelRouter([a, b])`` ordered failover until
a candidate starts failing repeatedly; see ``fallback_strategy`` for what it decides and when it departs
from declaration order. ``max_switches`` caps switches per invocation.

What an answer does depends on whether a failed model call is pending. A candidate is resolved and
applied. ``None`` declines: the opening choice then runs the router's default model, the first declared
candidate resolved without consulting any strategy, and a later decline ends routing so the model's error
surfaces. A strategy that raises propagates on the opening choice and ends routing after a failure, where
the pending model error stays the one that surfaces. A candidate that will not resolve to a model
propagates on the opening choice; after a failure it takes its slot in the round and the strategy is asked
again, so one unusable candidate does not strand the healthy ones declared after it.

A failure round uses each candidate at most once, whether it was switched to or found unusable, so naming
one the round already used ends routing; a success starts a new round on the candidate that succeeded,
which counts as that round's first use just as the opening choice does.

A nested ``ModelRouter`` contributes **one** candidate: it is asked with its own candidates and no
attempts, and performs no internal failover, so when a nested pick fails the outer router moves off the
whole nested candidate rather than advancing within it. A nested strategy that declines serves that
router's default model; one that raises makes that candidate unusable, which propagates on the opening
choice and costs it its slot in the round after a failure.

Known limitation: a model that fails after streaming part of a response has already emitted those
events, so a streaming consumer sees that partial output followed by the replacement's full response.
``AfterModelCallEvent`` documents this for any hook-requested retry; routing reaches it more often
because it advances on any failure the retry strategy declines, not only throttling.

Known limitation: routing applies to ``InvokeModelStage``, so ``agent.model`` stays the first declared
candidate and subsystems reading it reason about that model rather than the one running. Proactive
compression sizes against ``agent.model``'s context window, so routing among candidates with
materially different windows can under-compress and overflow the routed model; the agent span reports
the first candidate's model id; and ``Agent.structured_output()`` calls the model directly, bypassing
routing entirely. Prefer candidates with comparable context windows and tokenizers until the selected
model is threaded to those consumers.
